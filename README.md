# CryptoProject
This is an RSA implementation using the Java Cryptography Architecture. It uses the java.security and javax.crypto libraries to implement a public and private key generator. The program takes a .txt file and encrypts it using the RSA encryption algorithm (with generated public key). It saves the encrypted file as a single byte that is decrypted using the generated private key. The output values in the program are used to display the functionality of the program.
